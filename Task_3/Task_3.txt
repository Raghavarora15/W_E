Approach to Solving the Issue:

Task Prioritization: Since Task 2 is for a priority customer with a campaign going live in the next 2 days, it's critical to prioritize this task to meet the customer's deadline.

Request Extension for Task 1: Given the low-priority nature of Task 1 and the family emergency situation, I will request an extension for Task 1. This will allow me to focus my immediate efforts on completing Task 2 for the priority customer.

Complete Task 2: My primary focus will be on completing Task 2 to ensure that the priority customer's campaign goes live on time. I will allocate the necessary time and resources to accomplish this task within the next 2 days.

Address Task 1: Once Task 2 is completed and the priority customer's campaign is live, I will then shift my attention to Task 1. I will use the additional 3 days, considering the extension, to work on and complete Task 1 for the low-priority customer.

Subject: Approach to Handling Task Deadlines

Dear Sir,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you about a situation that has arisen regarding the upcoming tasks for our customers.

Due to an unexpected family emergency, I will not be able to meet the original due date for both tasks. Task 1, for our low-priority customer, and Task 2, for our priority customer with a campaign going live in 2 days, are affected.

To prioritize the timely launch of the priority customer's campaign, I will be focusing my immediate efforts on completing Task 2 within the next 2 days. I will then request a 3-day extension for Task 1 to ensure we can complete it properly.

I understand the importance of both tasks and assure you that I am committed to delivering high-quality results. I will keep you updated on my progress and any changes to the timeline.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this challenging time.

Best regards,
Raghav Arora
